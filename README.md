## Short Bio
I am a doctoral student (PhD) researching theoretical black hole (BH) physics at the University of Hong Kong. My supervisor is Prof. Jane Lixin Dai, an associate professor in the Department of Physics doing research on tidal disruption events (TDEs), general-relativistic-magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of jets and accretion disks, X-ray reverberations, and many other topics in high-energy astrophysics.

I was a former undergraduate physics researcher at CUHK, CERN, and LIGO. I conducted research on various topics in theoretical physics, namely gravitational physics, cosmology, and elementary particle physics. In particular, I used gravitational waves (GWs) to test general relativity (GR), and used ATLAS data to test the standard model (SM).

My current research interests are BH physics, BH perturbation theory, GW physics, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), TDEs, tests of GR, GR simulations, mathematical theory of BHs, and physics beyond GR.

Other interests of mine include complex systems, biophysics, fluid dynamics, Higgs physics, baryogenesis, inflationary cosmology, lepton flavor violation, neutrino cosmology, gauge theory, supersymmetry, and supergravity.
