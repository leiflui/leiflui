## About me
I am a doctoral student (PhD) researching theoretical black hole (BH) physics at the University of Hong Kong. My supervisor is Prof. Jane Lixin Dai, an associate professor in the Department of Physics doing research on tidal disruption events (TDEs), general-relativistic-magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of jets and accretion disks, X-ray reverberations, and many other topics in high-energy astrophysics.

I was a former undergraduate physics researcher at CUHK, CERN, and LIGO. I conducted research on various topics in theoretical physics, namely gravitational physics, cosmology, and elementary particle physics. In particular, I used gravitational waves (GWs) to test general relativity (GR), and used ATLAS data to test the standard model (SM).

My current research interests are BH physics, BH perturbation theory, GW physics, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), TDEs, tests of GR, GR simulations, mathematical theory of BHs, and physics beyond GR.

Other interests of mine include complex systems, biophysics, fluid dynamics, Higgs physics, baryogenesis, inflationary cosmology, lepton flavor violation, neutrino cosmology, gauge theory, supersymmetry, and supergravity.
## Languages that I frequently use
As a theorist, I mainly come up with mathematical models for physical phenomena and do many analytic/numerical calculations. For algebraic calculations and solving equations with analytic solutions, I primarily use Mathematica as it is a very user-friendly algebra-handling language. For numerical calculations, I mainly use Python and Matlab, as they both have packages optimized for things like numerical integration, matrix operations, Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulations, etc. I seldom use C/C++, as most of the calculations done in the languages above are sufficiently fast. I mainly use C++ for things like geodesic ray-tracing (GRT). Below are the languages summarized in a pie chart:
