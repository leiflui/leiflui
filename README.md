## About me
I am a doctoral student (PhD) in physics at the University of Hong Kong. My research area is theoretical physics, specifically focusing on black holes and gravitational waves. Gravitational waves astronomy has opened new avenues of exploring the universe and has enriched our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole binaries. I hope that my work on gravitational-wave templates will usher in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy with space-based detectors like LISA and TianQin.

My research integrates analytical approximations, numerical simulations, and machine learning to model astrophysical systems involving intermediate/extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs/EMRIs). Analytical approximations, such as black-hole perturbation theory, serve as the foundation for modeling black-hole spacetimes of IMRIs/EMRIs. Numerical simulations, such as geodesic ray tracing (GRT), are invaluable tools for modeling IMRI/EMRI orbits with more nuanced physical effects like orbiter-gas/disk interactions and tidal stripping. The unison of these techniques allows us to compute the gravitational-wave signal for more complex IMRI/EMRI systems, and the coupling of machine learning significantly aids in streamlining these intensive calculations.

Recently, I have been applying these techniques to model the gravitational-wave signals for quasi-periodic eruptions, tidal disruption events, and IMRIs/EMRIs in nuclear clusters. The goal is to provide a template for observers to reference for future detection with space-based gravitational-wave detectors, and enhance our understanding of the environments around IMRIs/EMRIs. 

My supervisor is Prof. Jane Lixin Dai, an associate professor in the Department of Physics doing research on tidal disruption events (TDEs), general-relativistic-radiative-magnetohydrodynamic (GRRMHD) simulations of jets and accretion disks, X-ray reverberations, and a plethora of other topics in high-energy astrophysics regarding BHs.

I was a former undergraduate physics researcher at CUHK, LIGO, and CERN. I conducted research on various topics in theoretical/computational physics, namely gravitational physics, cosmology, and elementary particle physics. In particular, I used gravitational waves to test general relativity (GR), and used ATLAS data to test the standard model (SM).

Other interests of mine include complex systems, biophysics, fluid dynamics, Higgs physics, baryogenesis, inflationary cosmology, lepton flavor violation, neutrino cosmology, gauge theory, supersymmetry, and supergravity.

## Languages that I frequently use
As a theorist, I mainly come up with mathematical models for physical phenomena and do many analytic/numerical calculations. For algebraic calculations and solving equations with analytic solutions, I primarily use Mathematica as it is a very user-friendly algebra-handling language. For numerical calculations, I mainly use Python, Matlab, and Julia, as they both have packages optimized for things like numerical integration, matrix operations, Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulations, etc. I seldom use C/C++, as most of the calculations done in the languages above are sufficiently fast. I mainly use C/C++ for things like geodesic ray tracing (GRT). Below is a pie chart summarizing the frequency of use for the languages mentioned above:

## Collaborations
I am interested in many areas of physics, mathematics, computer science, and any science-related discipline, so if you are interested in collaborating please feel free to contact me via email. Just note that I have some ongoing projects, so I may not have the time to fulfill all the requests for collaboration, but I will try my best. :relaxed:
